# Raspberry

This is a bot written in TS made with lots of rush, because it's a bot that runs in a Raspberry Pi Zero which purpose is nothing but waking up my PC. If you complain about me not using a command handler for this, please, don't. I have been busy doing a lot of things to bother making this fancy, plus this is a bot locked **exclusively to me**.
